# Python_Project_Take_A_Break
This program schedules a break time for one who works to many hours, reminding one to listen to music, get up and dance to their favorite song<br>
## 1. Instructions - How To Run The Program
### i. Install Python (Windows)
a. Navigate to the Python downloads page (https://www.python.org/downloads/) that indexes downloads for the most recent versions of Python.<br>
b. Download the Windows x86 MSI installer. If you're sure that your machine runs a 64-bit version of Windows, feel free to download the Windows x86-64 MSI installer instead.<br>
c. Once the download is finished, locate the file (it'll probably be in your Downloads directory) and run it. Note: the images below show Python 2.7.9, but the process is the same for newer versions.<br>
d. Follow the installation wizard. Let Python install to its default directory, C:\Python27\.<br>
e. Ensure that both "pip" is installed and that "Python" is added to your PATH.<br>
f. To confirm that your installation was successful, open IDLE, a program installed by Python that makes it easy to edit and run Python code.<br>
##### - Windows 7 (or earlier): Use the Start Menu to go to All Programs, then Python 2.7, and, finally, IDLE (Python GUI).
##### - Windows 8: Search for IDLE. Currently, you can search by swiping from the right edge of the screen or by using the lower-right corner of your screen if you have a mouse.<br>

### ii. Install Python (Mac)
a. Go to the Python downloads page that contains downloads for the most recent versions of Python.<br>
b. If you are using Mac OS X 10.6 or later, download the installer linked from that page. If you are using 10.5, you will need an alternate installer, the 32-bit i386/PPC installer.<br>
c. Open the file that you downloaded. It should either be called "python-2.7.12-macosx10.6.pkg" or "python-2.7.12-macosx10.5.pkg".<br>
d. Follow the steps in the Python Installer to successfully install Python.<br>
e. To confirm that your installation was successful, open IDLE, a program installed by Python that makes it easy to edit and run Python code.
##### - It should be in your Applications folder.
##### - You can also use Spotlight by pressing âŒ˜+Space and typing in "idle" to find it.
